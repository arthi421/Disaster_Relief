                    Following a crisis, research the different organizations that are active in the area and find a
                    group that aligns with your values and priorities.
                    Once you have identified an organization you would like to work with, confirm they are accepting
                    volunteers for the specific crisis. This is often noted on their website or social media pages.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        If the organization is providing volunteer opportunities, you will need to fill out an
                        application. This will usually include basic information about yourself, your skills and
                        experience, and your availability. Some organizations may require a background check or
                        references.
                        Once you have been accepted as a volunteer, the organization will likely provide training about
                        the specific role you will be playing, as well as safety and security protocols.

                    It’s important to realize that joining a disaster relief organization’s volunteer team can be
                    physically and emotionally demanding. You may be working long hours in difficult conditions, and you
                    may be exposed to traumatic events. Be prepared for the challenges of working in a crisis situation.
                    It is also important to keep in mind that volunteering during a crisis may not always be possible,
                    due to the nature of the crisis, the location, the organization’s policies, and a volunteer’s
                    personal situation.
